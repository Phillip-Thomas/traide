## Model Architecture Analysis

### Current Implementation
- Dueling DQN architecture for trading with hold/buy/sell actions
- Feature extraction network with LayerNorm and Dropout
- Orthogonal weight initialization for training stability
- Value and Advantage streams for action-value decomposition

### Areas for Enhancement

#### Architecture Improvements
- [ ] Add configurable layer sizes based on input complexity
- [ ] Implement deeper feature extraction for complex market data
- [ ] Add batch normalization before dropout layers
- [ ] Consider convolutional layers for temporal feature extraction
- [ ] Explore attention mechanisms for feature weighting
- [ ] Add LSTM/GRU layers for temporal dependencies

#### Modern DQN Features
- [ ] Implement Noisy Layers for better exploration
- [ ] Add Distributional DQN elements for uncertainty estimation
- [ ] Consider Rainbow DQN enhancements (PER, Multi-step, etc.)

#### Trading-Specific Considerations
- [ ] Adapt architecture based on trading frequency (HFT vs daily)
- [ ] Optimize for specific asset classes (crypto, stocks, forex)
- [ ] Add support for multi-asset trading
- [ ] Implement proper position sizing and risk management
